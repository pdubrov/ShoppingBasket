# ShoppingBasket

Assumptions:
1) All prices are in pences, including total price.
Convertion to pounds is not implemented to keep things simple.

2) Observation: 'three for the price of two' is equivalent to 'buy 2 get one free'.
That's why I used the same PricingStrategy implementation for both, but with different parameters.
 
3) juni4 library has to be added to classpath for tests to execute
